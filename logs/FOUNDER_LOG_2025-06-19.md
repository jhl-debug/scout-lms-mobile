# 🧠 Founder Log – June 19, 2025

### 📍 Summary
Today was all about foundational progress. While the UI didn’t change much on the surface, under the hood, major systems were configured and verified. The development environment is now fully operational.

### ✅ What Got Done
- Connected the **React Native mobile front-end** to the **existing Supabase back-end**
- Successfully configured and pushed both `scout-lms` (web) and `scout-lms-mobile` (mobile) projects to GitHub
- Set up SSH key authentication on the new **MacBook Pro M4 (Sokka Tech Enterprise)** to allow passwordless `git push`
- Installed and configured **GitHub Copilot** in VS Code and tested code suggestions/modifications
- Learned about the difference between **Git (version control)** and **GitHub (remote hosting)**
- Gained more comfort with **terminal navigation**, folder hierarchy, and naming conventions

### 💡 Lessons & Wins
- Groundwork is everything. Having a clean Git setup and repo flow will make scaling and collaboration much smoother.
- Copilot is now an active sidekick in VS Code—it’s helping parse and refactor unfamiliar files.
- Daily practice in terminal and Git is building intuitive confidence fast.

### 🚧 Up Next
- Fix layout bugs: SafeAreaView + status bar shifting
- Build out welcome and onboarding flows in React Native
- Test and validate Supabase interactions from mobile
- Set up end-to-end flows from login to module progress
